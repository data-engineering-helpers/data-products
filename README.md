# Overview
[This project](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/data-products)
intends to document requirements and referential material to implement
data contracts in the perspective of data engineering on a
modern data stack (MDS).

Data contracts are essential to decouple data producers from data consumers,
while having both parties taking responsibility for their respective parts.

Even though the members of the GitHub organization may be employed by
some companies, they speak on their personal behalf and do not represent
these companies.
